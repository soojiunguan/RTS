# Abstract
This report explores the use of Rust programming language to develop a real-time trading simulation system, emphasizing safety, performance, and concurrency. By leveraging Rustâ€™s ownership model and memory safety features, the system achieves reliable scheduling, asynchronous communication, and robust error handling. Performance benchmarks demonstrate stable concurrent execution, though some resource synchronization inefficiencies remain.
